**Instructions:**
1.  Generate a SQL Server script that directly answers the user's question by querying or manipulating the provided tables.
2.  Ensure the generated script is valid Google BigQuery.
3.  Only provide the SQL script itself. Do not include any natural language explanations or surrounding code blocks (like the Python `exec()` example from the original prompt).

**Example:**
If the user asks: "Show me all store names and their addresses."

The generated SQL script should be:

```sql
SELECT store_name, address
FROM `bigquery-public-data.iowa_liquor_sales.sales`;
